# 🧠 CleanTab — A CleanTab for a ClearMind

**CleanTab** is a free, privacy-first Chrome extension that helps you stay away from NSFW and distracting content.  
Unlike most blockers, CleanTab scans *inside* your active tabs (like Reddit, Twitter, or image-heavy sites) to detect unsafe or explicit visuals — and gently redirects you before you spiral.

## 🌿 Why I Built This

I built CleanTab as a personal mission to fight online distractions and unhealthy habits.  
I realized that most “NSFW blockers” only work on URLs — but not on what’s actually *displayed* inside a tab.

CleanTab changes that.  
It looks at what’s visible on your screen (not your history or private data) and helps you protect your focus, your productivity, and your peace of mind.

This project is completely free and open for anyone who wants to reclaim their attention and mental clarity.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Smart Detection** — analyzes active tabs to detect NSFW images or adult indicators.  
- 🚫 **Auto Redirect** — instantly redirects you to a safe or customizable page.

- 🧘 **Mindful Interface** — clean design, gentle feedback, and focus reminders.  
- ❤️ **Open Source** — contribute, customize, and make it yours.

## 🧭 How It Works

1. CleanTab monitors the currently active browser tab.  
2. When content is detected as NSFW or flagged by pattern rules (image analysis, keywords, or page context), it blocks and redirects.  
3. The redirect page reminds you to take a deep breath, refocus, or read a motivational quote.  

You can customize detection rules and redirect destinations easily.
